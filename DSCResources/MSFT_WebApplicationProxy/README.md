# Description

The WebApplicationProxy DSC resource manages the installation of the Web Application Proxy server role. To
further manage the configuration of WebApplicationProxy, the WebApplicationProxyConfiguration DSC resource
should be used.

Note: removal of the Web Application Proxy role using this resource is not supported. Remove the
Web-Application-Proxy role from the server instead.
